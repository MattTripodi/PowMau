 **Background:** 
My brother and I both have a passion for snowboarding and winter sports. We have come up with an idea that allows for extreme sports enthusiasts to experience the joys of their “board sports” no matter the season and no matter the location. In addition to connect with extreme sports enthusiasts, our goal is to also create an online marketplace for local business in seasonally busy regions in order for them to generate revenue year round even if it is the off season. Because our target audience is mostly likely someone who enjoys convenience and due to the fact that our competitors do not have an app developed yet, I have decided to create an app exclusively for the business that will help generate leads and gather data to ultimately help us make informed marketing decisions.
 
  **Research questions:** 

*	What is your favorite extreme sport/hobby? 

*	How much money do you spend each year on new equipment? 
*	Do you currently subscribe to any subscription boxes? 
*	How frequently do you find yourself browsing apps for shopping purposes?
	
	**Methodology:** Doing this research to find how likely consumers will be to use our app                  	
	
	**Participants:** Audience are those who are passionate about extreme sports – particularly boarding sports 
	
	 	**Schedule:** How important is convenience to you based on your daily schedule? Script:

**Device:** What is the usual device you find yourself making purchases on most?

**APP:** Have your seen any apps that are extreme sport specific?
