#Project Plan

**What are your overall objectives for the project? What problem(s) are you solving? What user goals are you making possible?**

*	The goal of this project is to provide skiers, snowboarders, skateboarders and surfers the convenience of a unique monthly subscription box delivered directly to their door from the convenience of an app. PowMau will help local surfing, skateboarding and winter sport communities reach a national audience all year versus seasonally. Through making an app accessible for both consumers and small business owners, PowMau will create a mobile marketplace for extreme sport aficionados.

**What is/are the main takeaways from your research findings? Briefly recap what you learned:**

*	My ultimate goal for this app is to allow a user to sign up as a member of PowMau by having them fill out their information such as name, email, password, gender, and clothing sizes. This information will be stored in Firebase, we will use this information to know which products and what sizes for clothing will be sent to them. 

**Who is your target audience?**

*	Extreme sport enthusiasts who may not have convenience of purchasing sport products year round
*	Extreme sport enthusiasts who are affluent and have “disposable income” to register for a subscription (assuming the registration will charge consumers ~$40 monthly)
*	Small business owners in surfing and summer sport communities looking to reach a national audience year round

**What features will you include? They should map to your user goals. Make sure you offer a coherent rationale for why they were chosen.**

*	Database (Firebase) - To store user account information 
*	Ability to search through the possible products they could receive in their monthly boxes 
*	A page to show various extreme sports videos 
*	An about us page so that users could learn more about PowMau and the founders  

**How will this differentiate from your competitors? What pain points are being addressed?**

While the marketplace for subscription boxes is perpetually growing across many niche hobbies and industries and may appear overcrowded, the “extreme sports” marketplace has minimal competition – especially in the world of board sports. That said, compared to competitors, PowMau will can be differentiated by the following:

*	Competitors have mobile friendly sites only – not a iOS application
*	Order completion can be made via mobile device on app via a subscription and billing information will not have to be manually entered each month
*	Customized user experience that is always on and accessible; creates an experience for consumers and businesses that is a convenient and always at the palm of their hands

**Are there any constraints you have to work with? (e.g. technological, timing, content, etc.)**

*	Because the pre-launch phase of PowMau will be heavily focused on generating leads on social media, the main purpose of the app for the first month will simply be to capture consumer data, making content limited in early phases until product is officially live

**Is there anything else you think might help us (your stakeholders) understand what you’re proposing?
An answer to this question: Why was this an app instead of a website?**

*	As mentioned above, because social media will play a key component in the key launch phase of PowMau  and as a part of the overall business plan – an app will drive consumers to “download” and can be part of both marketing and advertising 
*	The app will not only serve as a convenient place for on-the-go consumers to place orders and monitor their accounts, but it will also great a mobile marketplace and community that is user friendly for all parties involved
